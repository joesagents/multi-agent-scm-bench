"""Local smoke test — equivalent to `scm_bench test-bundle .`.

Run from the bundle root:

    pytest tests/test_local.py -v

This loads the bundle through the validator and runs a 5-tick smoke
simulation on `intro_step_demand`. If this passes, your bundle is
structurally valid and will be accepted by the operator's evaluator.
It does *not* tell you whether your policy is good — only whether it
is admissible.
